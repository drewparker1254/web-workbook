      <h3>Corrina Bright,  MS. Ed, CPDT-KA</h3>

<p>Corrina is committed to finding ways to improve the relationships between people and their pets. Embracing the knowledge of operant and classical conditioning as well as the dynamics that affect a person and their pet, she enjoys teaching new behaviors and helping change old ones.</p>

<p>Corrina initially began her professional career in education, teaching high school psychology and history. For many years she worked hard to come up with creative ways to teach students about the past and tried to impart a life-long desire for learning. In her spare time, she enjoyed training her own dogs in competitive sports such as agility, tracking, obedience and hunting. Corrina started training professionally during the evenings and weekends in 2007, focusing on helping owners create a well mannered family pet through classes.</p>

<p>A job promotion for her husband brought Corrina to Texas, and she began working with dogs and their people full time in 2009. She was the trainer at one of Kemah's finest kennels until 2013, when the decision was made to set out on her own business venture and create Canine Connection, L.P. The company is clearly focused on providing quality training and stresses improving the relationship between handler and canine. Classes in obedience, agility, and therapy dog are available as well as on-site and in-home training lessons.</p>

<p>Corrina has a Bachelors Degree in History, a minor in Business and a Masters Degree in Education and is focused on continuing education with seminars and workshops. In her quest for knowledge about canine behavior and canine performance training, she has attended numerous seminars and classes from some of the best trainers in the United States.</p>

<p>She is a  Certified Canine Good Citizen Evaluator. The CGC program is offered through the AKC and is recognized nationally. Dogs that have their CGC can help reduce the cost of home owners insurance, go into schools or other venues as therapy pets and impress friends and families with the wonderful accomplishment of being a Canine Good Citizen!</p>

<p>Corrina is also a Professional Member of the Association of Professional Dog Trainers (CPDT-KA) and a Certified Professional Dog Trainer. APDT is the leading organization for setting standards for professional dog trainers. It is the only organization offering standardized testing for trainers interested in being certified members.</p>
